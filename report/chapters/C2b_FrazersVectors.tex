\section{Weird Vector things}\label{TheBasics}
The fundamental unit of information in classical computing is the bit. Which takes one of two states usually represented with 0 or 1. Modern silicon chips realise this as the `on' or `off' state of a transistor. In an analogy with bits, the fundamental unit for quantum computing is the qubit. The represents the simplest, fully quantum system
